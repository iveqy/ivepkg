ivepkg is (aims to be) a package manager.

The focus is homebuilt distributions like Linux from scratch. Therefore ivepkg
has no repository or network abilities (as of now) but is specialized on
installing tarballs to a system.

The key features is an easy to use database (sqlite3) and sha1-checksum of every
installed file. This makes it impossible to not know about which files has been
altered, for example by a malicious attack.

This project is still very young. Contributions is welcommed as patches to
iveqy@iveqy.com or pull-requests.
